# !!! Coming from a background in data science in my undergad I never used any language other than python so this project was extremely hard for me, adding that I have no background in advanced networks and firewalls. I managed to do the coding part but I was unable to compile it with C++ compiler. It kept saying the files weren't in my project directory when infact ther wer. Due to that I was unable to execute the firewall itself.

# Firewall Project
